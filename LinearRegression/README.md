# Linear Regression Algorithm
The code for this algorithm takes input data and uses linear regession to calculate the intercept and slope of data points, as well as the R squared value. 
## Inputs: 
* x-values of the data set
* y-values of the data set
## Outputs:
* Filtered x-values (i.e. the input x-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Filtered y-valeus (i.e. the input y-values but without the outlier points), sorted from smallest to largest
* Slope from the linear regression (m in )
* Intercept from the linear regression (b in )
* Rsquared value
