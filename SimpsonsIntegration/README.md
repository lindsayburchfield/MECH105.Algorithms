# Simpon's Rule Integration Algorithm
This code is an algorithm that takes user's given x and y values and operates Simpson's 1/3 rule, calculating the integral for the user's data. The Trapezoidal Rule will be used for the final interval if the data has an even number of segments.
## Inputs
* x - vector of equally spaced independent variables
* y - vector of fucntion values with respect to x
## Outputs
* I - numerical integral
