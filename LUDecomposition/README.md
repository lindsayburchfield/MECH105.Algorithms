# LU Decomposition Algorithm
This code is an algorithm that takes an input A matrix and operates LU decomposition and Gauss elimination to find the lower, upper, and pivot matrices.
## Inputs
* A - coefficient matrix
## Outputs
* L - lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U - upper triangular matrix
* P - the pivot matrix
